# PR Focus

PR Focus is a macOS app that makes it easy for you to watch important pull requests across multiple repositories - and ignore the ones you don't care about.

This repository is for the PR Focus website at: https://prfocus/app

Because the PR Focus macOS code is in a private repository, I'm using this website repository to track issues both on the app itself, and on the website.

Feel free to create an issue or add a feature request for either the app or the website here: [New issue](https://github.com/dacharyc/prfocus-website/issues/new/choose)
