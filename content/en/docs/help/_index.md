You can use one of these methods to get help:

*Note: I'm so excited you're interested in PR Focus, but I'm just one person and developing this app is not my day job. I will do my best to get back to you quickly, but can't make any guarantees about response times. Thank you for your patience, and for helping me make PR Focus more awesome!*

## PR Focus Help Menu

- File an issue on the PR Focus website's GitHub repository
- Request a feature on the PR Focus website's GitHub repository
- Reach out through social media

## Social Media

PR Focus has a social media account on [Mastodon](https://corporaterunaways.social/@prfocus). Feel free to follow for app updates, or reach out through Mastodon for help.
