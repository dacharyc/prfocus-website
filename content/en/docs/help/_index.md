Need help with PR Focus?

Currently, the app is in private alpha on TestFlight. 

When slots open for the closed beta, PR Focus will announce the availability of beta test spots on its [Mastodon](https://corporaterunaways.social/@prfocus) account.

You can use one of these methods to get help:

- Report feedback via TestFlight (you can attach screenshots)
- Reach out to the developer directly (you can send screenshots)
- File an Issue on the PR Focus website GitHub repository (you can attach screenshots, but the repository is public)
- Send a support email (you can't attach screenshots)

*Note: I'm so excited you're interested in PR Focus, but I'm just one person and developing this app is not my day job. I will do my best to get back to you quickly, but can't make any guarantees about response times. Thank you for your patience, and for helping me make PR Focus more awesome!*

## PR Focus Help Menu

The PR Focus `Help` menu has several options to make it easier to get help. While PR Focus is running, select the Help menu to:

- View the PR Focus documentation site (that's the site you're looking at now!)
- File an issue on the PR Focus website's GitHub repository
- Request a feature on the PR Focus website's GitHub repository

## Reach me directly

Currently, PR Focus is in a private beta with people I know personally. Use a method you know to reach me personally.

## GitHub

The PR Focus macOS app repository is private. You can [file a GitHub issue on the PR Focus website](https://github.com/dacharyc/prfocus-website/issues/new/choose) for suggestions or improvements for the documentation, *or* for the PR Focus app. When filing an issue, please [label](https://github.com/dacharyc/prfocus-website/labels) your issue with `PR Focus App` or `PR Focus Website` for a faster response.

## Send an Email

If you prefer not to provide details publicly in a GitHub issue, you can send me a support email.
