  Watch important PRs across repositories - and ignore the rest.
---

Get an overview of pull requests across repositories you watch, or dive deep into the details of a specific repository or pull request.

PR Focus gives you a snapshot of PRs in flight so you don't miss any important work that needs your attention. Impress your colleagues by always knowing about the latest status of oustanding work, and eliminate the time-wasting of having to click around multiple repositories to check on work that matters to you.

## What is PR Focus?

PR Focus is a macOS app that lets you keep track of important pull requests across repositories.

There are two ways to track PRs across repositories:

- Find out about every PR that gets opened in a repository, and decide whether to watch or ignore each one.
- Add specific PRs to PR Focus, and watch their progress.

PR Focus includes logic to automatically remove archived or inactive PRs from your views, letting you focus only on the PRs that matter to you.

### Watch Repositories

Add repositories to watch, and PR Focus pulls down open pull requests in those repositories. New pull requests go into your **Inbox**, where you can decide whether you want to watch or ignore them. 

Separate sections of the dashboard let you keep track of pull requests where:

- You're a reviewer on the PR
- You're assigned to the PR
- You are the person who made the PR

The main dashboard shows all your in-flight PRs. Or you can drill into a specific repository to get a focused snapshot of the work you're watching.

### Watch PRs

If a repository is highly active, or if it's not part your regular workflow, you might want to watch only specific PRs in the repository - not find out about every new PR that's opened there. You can add "Solo PRs" to PR Focus to keep track of progress on important PRs even if you're not watching the repository.

## Why do I want it?

PR Focus is a tool for watching PRs across repositories.

* **What is it good for?** PR Focus was written by a technical writer who needs to keep track of engineering pull requests across multiple upstream repositories, and colleagues' pull requests across multiple documentation repositories. You might find it useful if you are a contributor to or maintainer of more than one repository, and want a single dashboard to keep track of work across those repositories.

* **What is it not good for?** PR Focus is about *watching* the work that's happening in repositories, not making contributions to them. You cannot make PRs or reply to PRs from PR Focus, although the app contains many links to relevant destinations on GitHub to enable you to easily engage directly via GitHub.
