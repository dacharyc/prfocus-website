You can add a repository to PR Focus using the **Add a Repository** button in the toolbar.

This opens a pane asking for details about the repository you want to add. 

Enter a GitHub URL for the repository you want to add, similar to `https://github.com/dacharyc/prfocus-website`.

You can also select a color for the repository pill to help visually distinguish the repository in a list.

Press the **Add Repository** button to add the repo to the list of repositories you're watching.

The repository appears in the sidebar. You can now press the **Fetch PRs** button to get the open pull requests in the repository from GitHub. 

If you view your **User Profile**, you'll see the repository in your list of **Watched Repositories**. From here, you can click a link to view the repository in GitHub.
