You can delete a repository from PR Focus by going to the **Add or Remove Repos** button in the sidebar.

This opens the pane where you can manage the list of repositories you're watching.

Find the row for the repository you want to delete, and press the **Delete repo** button. This deletes the repository and all of its pull requests from PR Focus.
