  View the Repository Dashboard to see only PRs for that repository or change repo settings.

When you select a repository in the sidebar, this opens the Repository Dashboard. This shows all of the pull requests associated with a specific repository that you're watching. You might want to view a specfic repository instead of the **All Pull Requests** dashboard if you want to focus in on the work in a specific project.

From here, you have the same options as in the **All Pull Requests** dashboard:

- Manage incoming PRs
- View any PR in GitHub
- View the details of a specific PR in PR Focus

For more details about these options, refer to [All Pull Requests]({{< ref "docs/pull-requests/all-prs.md" >}}).

## The Repository Dashboard

The Repository Dashboard breaks down into different lists of pull requests, similar to the **All Pull Requests** dashboard. But you can customize the columns you see in a repository dashboard for a specific repository.

For example, if you will never make a pull request in a repository, but you may be a reviewer there, you can select "I might be a reviewer" and de-select the other options. Then, you only see the "Reviewing PRs" column when you view that repository's dashboard. For more details about customizing the repository dashboard view, refer to [Repository Settings]({{< ref "docs/repositories/manage-repository.md" >}}).
