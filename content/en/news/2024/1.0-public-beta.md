The PR Focus 1.0 release candidate is available for public beta testing! This is the final planned build before the 1.0 release. You can give PR Focus a try and enjoy the full range of features planned for launch. Spots are limited! Join the beta through this [TestFlight Public Beta Group](https://testflight.apple.com/join/PmdjrF6U). I welcome any bug reports or feature requests!

I've already got plans for the first post-1.0 features, which include:

- Apply tags to PRs in PR Focus, independent of any GitHub labels. Think of them as private labels!
  - A new dashboard enables you to filter PRs by your applied tags, and an optional date range. Use it to generate reports on key initiatives or highlight the work your team is doing.
  - Easily keep track of feature or release-specific work across repositories.
- Filter PRs to automatically Watch, Ignore, or apply tags based on keywords or the PR author.
- Search for PRs by keyword or PR author.
- Customization options for what dashboards to see in the sidebar, and how to organize them.

These are all feature requests that have come through the public beta so far. I've also squashed six bugs. I really appreciate all the great ideas and all the bug reports!
