## Description

PR Focus makes it easy to watch important pull requests across repositories that matter to you, and ignore the pull requests you don't care about. It's a self-updating PR dashboard that makes it easy to spot pull requests with updates that may need your attention.

### Watch repositories in one place

Watch incoming pull requests across multiple repositories - all in one place.

* See PRs that are opened in repositories you're watching, and choose whether to **Watch** or **Ignore** them.
* Get a summary of everything in one place in the *All Pull Requests* dashboard.
* Drill down into individual *Repository Dashboards* to focus in on the work in a specific repository.
* Alternately, watch individual pull requests instead of everything that comes through a repo.

### Track PR progress

Find out about updates to pull requests - without having to leave the app.

* PRs with updates change color to let you know there's something new.
* PR workflow *Checks*, *Commits*, *Comments*, or *Reviews* are bolded when there are updates so you can quickly scan what's new.
* View all the relevant PR details without leaving the app; changes have a **New** label.
* Every workflow *Check*, *Commit*, *Comment*, or *Review* has a link to go directly to the element in GitHub. Click through to the GitHub UI to drill into failed checks, see what's changed in a commit, or reply to important comments.
* PRs that haven't been updated for a while automatically move out of your main dashboard to a special *Inactive PRs* dashboard. They get out of the way of your everyday work, but go to a dedicated dashboard so you don't forget about them.
* PRs that are closed automatically move to the *Archived PRs* dashboard.

## About the Developer

[Dachary Carey](https://dacharycarey.com) is a technical writer who works on Developer Documentation by day, and writes apps by necessity.

PR Focus was born to eliminate the countless hours spent trying to figure out what actually got delivered, and what still needs attention. With PR Focus, her team can focus on the souce of truth - the code - instead of relying on Jira tickets or Google documents that may not reflect the state of reality, or even exist in the first place.

When she started playing Elden Ring, Dachary found the lack of quest tracking, and indication of where to find the important characters, a big departure from the RPGs she typically played. She wrote [Shattered Ring](https://shatteredring.com), an iOS app to track RPG playthroughs. Now she knows where to find the important people, places, and quests she encountered along the way.

More problems to solve means more apps are in the works...
