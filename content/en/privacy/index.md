PR Focus is a macOS app written by Dachary Carey.

The PR Focus website is designed to provide information about the PR Focus app for users who may be interested in its functionality.

The privacy policy detailed herein applies to both the:

- PR Focus macOS App

# The PR Focus macOS App

Dachary Carey built the PR Focus macOS App. This SERVICE is provided by Dachary Carey and is intended for use as-is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decides to use my Service.

If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

## Information Collection and Use

The PR Focus app saves repository and PR details to a file on your device. The data never leaves your device. I never have access to that data, and do not attempt to collect any data for personal use.

PR Focus uses a GitHub API key that you provide to make GraphQL API calls on your behalf to retrieve PR details for the repositories you specify. PR Focus saves this API key to your keychain. It never leaves your machine except to authorize API calls to GitHub on your behalf.

## Log Data

If you request support for a bug, I may ask for details about your app usage or Log Data from your device to help me reproduce and diagnose the bug. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing my Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics. Providing that information is completely up to you, and I only use that data to debug issues you report.

PR Focus also prints data to a log that you can access while the app is running. That data is only retained in memory during app execution, and is cleared when you close the app. That information never leaves your machine. You can clear this log at any point during app execution. For details, refer to [View Logs](https://prfocus.app/docs/help/view-logs/) in the PR Focus documentation.

## Cookies

Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.

Neither the PR Focus app nor the PR Focus Website uses these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app or website may use third-party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.

## Service Providers

I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:

*   To facilitate our Service;
*   To provide the Service on our behalf;
*   To perform Service-related services; or
*   To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.

I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties may have access to personal data. Third-party services may use analytics to collect usage about their product. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.

Currently, the third-party company used in this app is:

* [Atlas Device SDK by MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/realm)

## Security

I value your trust in using our Service, thus I strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Children’s Privacy

I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. I encourage all children to never submit any personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services. I encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child has provided personally identifiable information to us through the Application and/or Services, please contact us. You must also be at least 16 years of age to consent to the processing of your personally identifiable information in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

This policy is effective as of 2024-07-06
