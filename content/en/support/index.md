Need help with the PR Focus app? You've got options!

## GitHub

The PR Focus macOS app repository is private. So I'm taking [GitHub issues on the PR Focus website repository](https://github.com/dacharyc/prfocus-website/issues/new/choose) for the PR Focus app *or* for suggestions or improvements for the documentation.

When filing an issue, please [label](https://github.com/dacharyc/prfocus-website/labels) your issue with `PR Focus App` or `PR Focus Website` for a faster response.

For your convenience, feel free to use one of these issue types pre-populated with labels for PR Focus App support:

- [File a bug report on GitHub](https://github.com/dacharyc/prfocus-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug%2C+PR+Focus+App&projects=&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBug%5D+%28App+or+Website+-+pick+one%21%29%3A+)
- [Request a feature on GitHub](https://github.com/dacharyc/prfocus-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement%2C+PR+Focus+App&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=%5BFeature%5D+%28App+or+Website+-+pick+one%21%29%3A+)

## Social Media

PR Focus has a [social media account](https://corporaterunaways.social/@prfocus) on Mastodon. Feel free to follow for app updates, or reach out through the Fediverse for help.

## Send an Email

If you prefer not to provide details publicly in a GitHub issue, you can send me a support email.

## Response Times

I'm so excited you're interested in PR Focus, but I'm just one person and developing this app is not my day job. I will do my best to get back to you quickly, but can't make any guarantees about response times. Thank you for your patience, and for helping me make PR Focus more awesome!
