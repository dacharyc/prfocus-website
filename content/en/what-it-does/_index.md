PR Focus is a macOS app that makes it easy to track pull requests across repositories - without going to GitHub.

## Watch repositories in one place

Watch incoming pull requests across multiple repositories - all in one place.

* See PRs that are opened in repositories you're watching, and choose whether to **Watch** or **Ignore** them.
* View the default *All Pull Requests* dashboard for a summary view of everything in one place.
* Drill down into individual *Repository Dashboards* to focus in on the work in a specific repository.
* Watch individual pull requests if you don't want to see everything that comes through a repository.

## Track PR progress

Find out about updates to pull requests - without having to leave the app.

* PRs with updates change color to let you know there's something new.
* PR workflow *Checks*, *Commits*, *Comments*, or *Reviews* are bolded when there are updates so you can quickly scan what's new.
* Click into a pull request to view all the relevant PR details without leaving the app. Changes since you last viewed the details have a **New** label.
* Every workflow *Check*, *Commit*, *Comment*, or *Review* has a link to go directly to the element in GitHub. Easily view failed pull request checks, see what's new in a commit, or reply to important comments.
* PRs that haven't been updated for a while automatically move out of your main dashboard to a special *Inactive PRs* dashboard. They get out of the way of your everyday work, but go to a dedicated dashboard so you don't forget about them.
* PRs that are closed automatically move to the *Archived PRs* dashboard. They disappear from your main dashboard when they're no longer relevant, but you can always view the details again in their dedicated dashboard.

## Don't lose sight of PRs that involve you

Easily see what's new in pull requests that involve you.

* PRs where you're an *Assignee*, a *Reviewer*, or the *PR author* automatically appear in dedicated lists in the *All Pull Requests* dashboard and in each *Repository Dashboard*.
* Even if you **Ignore** a PR, if you later become an *Assignee* or *Reviewer*, the pull request automatically becomes visible again in the relevant list in your dashboards.
* Easily see when there are new workflow *Checks*, *Commits*, *Comments*, or *Reviews* that require your attention in the PRs that involve you.
