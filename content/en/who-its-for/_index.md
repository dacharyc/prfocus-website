## Developers

Donâ€™t lose sight of PRs that involve you.

* Always have eyes on your own pull requests in *My PRs*.
  * See when your PRs have been reviewed.
  * Find out when you've got failing tests you need to fix.
  * See a red *X* when a teammate merges something that introduces merge conflicts. 
* See a roundup of PRs you can't miss in the *Reviewing PRs* and *Assignee PRs* columns.
  * No more forgetting, or not realizing, that someone tagged you on a PR and it's waiting for your input.
  * Easily spot when PRs you're reviewing or assigned to have had updates, and go back and revisit them.
* Find out when your teammates make PRs that might affect your work.
  * **Watch** PRs that you need to pay attention to.
  * **Ignore** PRs that are routine or automated, and don't affect your work.
* Watch individual pull requests in repositories you don't visit every day.
  * Keep an eye on the progress of an important patch or new feature in a library you're using.
  * Watch your own PRs in repos you don't work in regularly.
* Find out when someone contributes to your open-source projects.
  * Don't miss a pull request for weeks or months in repos you maintain but don't visit often.
  * Find out when contributors make updates to their PRs and you need to take action again.

## Technical Writers

Whether you work in a docs-as-code team, or just need to watch engineering work.

* When engineering code is the source of truth, always know its status.
  * Is it merged? In progress? Has it been gathering dust for a month? Don't rely on Jira or external systems that may not reflect what engineering is doing.
* Find out about things they forget to tell you.
  * Not every code change gets a "Docs Needed" flag. When you see every engineering PR, you find out about code changes that need docs updates.
  * **Ignore** things like new tests and internal dependency updates. Only **Watch** attention to things that have docs impact.
* Keep track of your own work in a docs-as-code team.
  * See everything in the "Developer" section above! Keep track of updates to your own PRs, or PRs where you're an assignee or reviewer.
* Win friends and influence people.
  * Seriously. When you know what's going on, you look very competent. You *are* more competent. I'm not saying you'll *definitely* get a promotion, but...

## Team Leads

Easily keep an eye on what your team is doing.

* **Watch** important PRs, so you can communicate their status when you're asked.
  * Time-sensitive.
  * Customer impact.
  * High stakeholder value.
* **Ignore** PRs that don't matter to you, like automated Snyk updates or low-priority maintenance work.
* Keep an eye on team health.
  * See PRs that have been untouched for a long time in the *Inactive PRs* dashboard. Can they be closed? Should work be shuffled to get them moving again?
  * **Watch** a specific team member's PRs if they have trouble getting them through review or need technical help. Step in when there's a coaching opportunity, or acknowledge progress when they make improvements.
  * Make sure the right people are doing the right work. Don't let your seniors spin their wheels on junior tasks. See when people are doing glue work.

## Project Managers

Stop chasing engineers for updates!

* **Watch** PRs for important projects you're managing, such as adding a new feature or integrating a new technology.
* **Ignore** PRs for routine work or projects you don't care about.
* Follow up with team members when things get stuck.
  * Find out what's needed to get things moving again.
  * Reassign resources or communicate to stakeholders when blockers arise.
  * Don't wait until someone tells you there's a problem - check in periodically (or when you *don't* see updates) to see what's happening.

## Agencies and Contractors

Keep track of work across many repositories.

* **Watch** only the PRs that involve you, and **Ignore** internal client PRs that don't affect you.
* Always have a snapshot of the status of ongoing work.
* Easily see when there are new updates.
  * Follow up with customers when things are stalled waiting for their input or review.
  * Follow up with employees if important work isn't proceeding.
  * Figure out where you have over-allocated and under-allocated resources, and move people around to get things done.
